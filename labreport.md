Friday, September 30, you’ll submit a lab report by writing a blog post like we just described. The topic will be remote access.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. Your post should include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did. If for some reason you didn’t do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked differently, etc).

Installing VScode
Remotely Connecting
Trying Some Commands
Moving Files with scp
Setting an SSH Key
Optimizing Remote Running
You should complete the writing on your own. Feel free to ask anyone (staff or other students are fine!) for help if you’re struggling to get remote access set up, understand commands, get your writing to show up on Github Pages, etc. But do not get help from anyone on authoring the report itself – the writing and screenshots must be your own.

You will upload your submission by publishing the page on Github Pages, then printing the page to PDF and uploading to the Lab Report 1 assignment on Gradescope.

Hey future self! This is you from the past reminding you what you did for this lab assignment.

Your first actual task (excluding all the boring introductions) was to install VScode and even github. Two things that should've already been downloaded to start this lab.
